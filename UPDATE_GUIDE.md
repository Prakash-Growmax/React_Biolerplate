# Boilerplate Update Guide

This document provides detailed instructions on how to keep your project up-to-date with the latest changes from the React Boilerplate.

## Understanding Mandatory Updates

All updates from the boilerplate are **mandatory**. This policy ensures:

- Consistent standards across all projects
- Security patches are promptly applied
- All teams benefit from performance improvements and new features
- Reduced technical debt across projects

## Update Process

### Regular Updates (Recommended: Bi-weekly)

1. **Fetch the latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

2. **View what has changed**:
   ```bash
   git log HEAD..upstream/main --oneline
   ```

3. **Merge the changes into your branch**:
   ```bash
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

4. **Resolve any merge conflicts**:
   If conflicts occur, Git will notify you. Resolve the conflicts in each file and then:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts with boilerplate update"
   ```

5. **Update dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

6. **Run tests and linting**:
   ```bash
   yarn lint
   yarn test
   ```

7. **Test the application locally**:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

### Handling Major Updates

For major version updates (e.g., 1.0.0 to 2.0.0):

1. **Review the CHANGELOG.md** in the upstream repository for breaking changes
2. **Create a dedicated branch** for the update:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b boilerplate-update-v2.0.0
   ```
3. **Follow the regular update process** above
4. **Create a pull request** for team review before merging

## Update Verification Checklist

After merging updates, verify the following:

- [ ] Application builds successfully
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors exist
- [ ] Core features function as expected
- [ ] New features from the boilerplate work correctly
- [ ] Performance has not degraded

## Troubleshooting Common Update Issues

### Dependency Conflicts

If you encounter dependency conflicts:

1. Check your `package.json` for custom dependencies
2. Resolve version conflicts in favor of the boilerplate versions
3. Use `yarn why <package-name>` to understand dependency relationships

### Build Failures After Update

If the build fails after an update:

1. Check for TypeScript errors:
   ```bash
   yarn tsc --noEmit
   ```
2. Look for incompatible imports or component usage
3. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set

### Component Breaking Changes

If UI components behave differently after update:

1. Check the component documentation in the boilerplate
2. Review prop changes and make necessary adjustments
3. Update component usage to match new API

## Getting Help

If you encounter persistent issues during the update process:

1. Create an issue in the boilerplate repository with details
2. Include specific error messages and steps to reproduce
3. Mention any custom modifications in your project that might be affected

Remember: Keeping your project up-to-date with the boilerplate is a team responsibility. Schedule regular update sessions to maintain alignment with the organization's standards.
